So I built my first "webpage" which was the Google homepage. It came out better than I expected. However, on closer inspection I realised that my method was unconventional. So I decided to compare my work to that of Google itself as well as other students who had completed their's on Odin. Below are my learnings:
Good:
- I managed to get the overall design correct.
- I divided the parts accordingly.
Bad
- Need to use CSS more efficiently.
1. Learning:
1.a General
- Need to define margin, padding and border as 0 right on top
- Need to define display (ideally as block right on top). Block is preferred if you want each element to start on a new line and take up the whole width
1.b Header
- Remeber to declare font size here if its the same across the board
- Use list-style type to remove the bullet points
- Use inline-block for top bar navigation
1.c Main
- Use background-image to add an image into the text bar/form
- User other properties like background-size, repeat, position to control other aspects
- For placing the buttons besides each other, use inline-block display just like for topbar
1.d Footer
- Use display flex for ease of centering text
